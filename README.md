#### Notes...

- **RTM** - Sometimes I give the command you need and sometimes you have to read the documentation to find it.
- **Details** - Following the instructions, especially those with a ✏️
- **Reference** - If you get stuck compare your code with the book [source code](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-C-8-by-Developing-Games-with-Unity-2020)
